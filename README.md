# Psychic-Game

This is a game where the user presses keys to guess which letter Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson is thinking of.  They have 10 chances to win, before they are insulted by "The Rock" and he thinks of a different letter.  It keeps track of wins and losses, as well as displaying which letters (and incorrect inputs!) the user has already guessed.
